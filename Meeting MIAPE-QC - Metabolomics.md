- _**For Untargeted Metabolomics **_
  - In untargeted metabolomic studies, data analysis strategies require some steps involving raw data acquisition, normalization, scaling and feature and peak detection in order to finally reach biomarker detection and identification. 

## Data Processing & Quality Evaluation

From the raw data acquired, observe the following metrics from indicative chromatographic peaks located at the beginning, middle and end of the chromatogram.

- Peak Width
- Retention Time
- Peak Intensity
- Mass accuracy
- Noise Intensity

This study presented a **Personal [Organism]** metabolomics profile from **a single individual over a 10-month period [Sample Description]**. About 120 uL of **the serum sample [Tissue/Cell Type]** was used for this study. **Metabolites were extracted by adding four times volume of equal-volume mixture of methanol, acetonitrile, and acetone that were pre-chilled at -20°C. Proteins were precipitated by incubating the samples at -20°C for 1 h. Samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and dried for metabolomics analysis [Sample Preparation Description]**. The identification of metabolites from the extracted samples were using **Agilent 1260 LC system and Agilent 6538 Q-TOF MS spectrometer [Instrument Description]** equipped with **electrospray ionization [Ion Source]**. The analysis was performed **in positive (ESI+) mode [ionization mode]**. Data were recorded for the **m/z region of 50–1000 in V-mode [m/z Region]** with **a scan time of 0.20s [Scan Time]** and **dwell time of 0.01s [Dwell Time]** between scans. The samples were analyzed **in random order [Sample Analysis Order]** and **QC samples were analyzed every 5 samples[QC Sample Analysis Order]**. For the chromatography alignment, only ions **with intensity above 5,000 counts [Ion Intensity]** and **retention time window within 0.2 min [Retention Time]** were selected.

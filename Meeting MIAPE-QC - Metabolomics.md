- Organism
- Sample Description
- Tissue/Cell Type
- Sample Preparation Description
- _**Analytical Sequence Preparation (Under discussion)**_
  - To avoid introducing bias due to changes with individual analytical runs and between run “batch effects”. The sample older of the samples should be randomized. [**Sample analysis order**] and QC samples should not be randomized but inserted regularly in the run sequence. [**QC sample analysis order**] 
  - Standard solution injections and blank sample injections should be avoided within the batch of test samples, as the system can be disequilibrated by the injection of non-matrix solutions. (eg. Insert the spiked test mix solution in the middle of the sequence and at the end after column equilibration)

- _**For Untargeted Metabolomics Data Processing**_
  - In untargeted metabolomic studies, data analysis strategies require some steps involving raw data acquisition, normalization, scaling and feature and peak detection in order to finally reach biomarker detection and identification.

This study presented a **Personal [Organism]** metabolomics profile from **a single individual over a 10-month period [Sample Description]**. About 120 uL of **the serum sample [Tissue/Cell Type]** was used for this study. **Metabolites were extracted by adding four times volume of equal-volume mixture of methanol, acetonitrile, and acetone that were pre-chilled at -20°C. Proteins were precipitated by incubating the samples at -20°C for 1 h. Samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and dried for metabolomics analysis [Sample Preparation Description]**. The identification of metabolites from the extracted samples were using **Agilent 1260 LC system and Agilent 6538 Q-TOF MS spectrometer [Instrument Description]** equipped with **electrospray ionization [Ion Source]**. The analysis was performed **in positive (ESI+) mode [ionization mode]**. Data were recorded for the **m/z region of 50–1000 in V-mode [m/z Region]** with **a scan time of 0.20s [Scan Time]** and **dwell time of 0.01s [Dwell Time]** between scans.The samples were analyzed **in random order [Sample Analysis Order]** and **QC samples were analyzed every 5 samples[QC Sample Analysis Order]**. For the chromatography alignment, only ions **with intensity above 5,000 counts [Ion Intensity]** and **retention time window within 0.2 min [Retention Time]** were selected.
